      let CartQuantity = 0;
      //we can also  use 'CartQuantity +=2' as a shortcut for the button +2
     //it works for both button 1 and 3 also but for button 1 there's even a shorter method which is "CartQuantity++;"
     //remember to always end your code with a semi colon sharp
     // theese methods can also be applied with other operators like *2=, /2= --= and so on shey you get sharp
     // camelCase is the standard naming convection for JS where the first word start with a lower case we have also PascalCase and also kebab-case but this won't work on JS because JS treat - as minus sign and finally snake_case not really used in JS
